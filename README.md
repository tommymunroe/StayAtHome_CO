# StayAtHome_CO
Academic project analyzing the effects of Stay-at-Home (SaH) orders on Carbon Monoxide levels in the United States.

This project was done using Stata (although a lot of my data cleaning was done using Python, I had to include some data
cleaning in my Stata do-files for the sake of my grade as this was done for my Econometrics II course at the University
of Utah).

I analyze the effect of SaH orders on CO levels in the states that enacted SaH orders. I also analyze whether the date the
orders were enacted had any significant effect on CO levels.

I analyzed pre-trends and used an event study method to analyze this data.
